This app provides a visualization of Philadelphia crime data (Parts I and II) spanning 2012-2014. The data is available via [OpenDataPhilly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents/resource/d8e013b7-748a-4592-9688-897b4ea2290e). All entries labeled as 'All Other Offenses' were removed prior to processing. The seasonal and trend components of the monthly incident counts are calculated using an additive model and moving average filter.
